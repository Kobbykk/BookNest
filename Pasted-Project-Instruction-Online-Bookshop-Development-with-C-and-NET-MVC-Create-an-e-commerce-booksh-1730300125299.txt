Project Instruction: Online Bookshop Development with C# and .NET MVC

Create an e-commerce bookshop application using C# and .NET MVC framework, implementing the following features:

    User Authentication:
        Use ASP.NET Identity for user registration, login, and logout.
        Ensure secure storage of user data with hashed passwords.

    Book Listings:
        Display available books on the home page with details such as title, author, price, and cover image.
        Implement a "Details" button for each book that navigates to a detailed view with additional information.

    Shopping Cart:
        Allow users to add books to a shopping cart.
        Include options to update quantities or remove items from the cart.
        Show the cart total and a “Proceed to Checkout” option.

    Purchasing System:
        Implement a checkout process where users review their order summary and confirm purchase.
        Integrate Stripe or PayPal for real payment processing, or set up a test payment method for development.

    Order Management:
        Provide an order history view where users can see their past orders.
        Implement order status updates (e.g., pending, completed, shipped) in the admin section.

    Admin Panel:
        Develop an admin area with CRUD functionalities for managing books, users, and orders.
        Add features to apply discounts, update prices, and manage book categories.

    Frontend UI:
        Use Razor Views for the frontend UI.
        Make it responsive and user-friendly, with components similar to the provided design (book cards, prices, and details).
        Consider using Bootstrap for layout and styling.

    Database:
        Use Entity Framework Core with SQL Server or SQLite to store user, book, and order data.

    Additional Features (optional):
        Implement a search bar and category filter for finding specific books.
        Enable user reviews and ratings for each book.

Testing and Deployment:

    Perform unit tests and integration tests for all key features.
    Deploy the application on Azure or another suitable hosting service.
